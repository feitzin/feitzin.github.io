## Hey!

![A scribbled likeness of myself.](/assets/img/profile.png){:height="256px" width="256px"}

I'm [Fei-Tzin](about.html), a final-year PhD candidate in [NLP at Columbia University](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi). I am advised by [Kathy McKeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/).

My thesis work explores applications of structured semantic representations of text. My [candidacy exam](candidacy.html) was on word embeddings.

I formerly co-organized the [NLP seminar at Columbia](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/nlp_seminar.html) along with [Emily Allaway](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~eallaway/). If you're looking for the current organizers, contact [Siyan Li](https://siyan-sylvia-li.com) or [Debasmita Bhattacharya](https://d-bhattacharya.github.io)! I am also no longer the administrator of the public [Columbia NLP mailing list](https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/nlp-announce) or the internal Columbia NLP group mailing list. If you are currently doing research with a Columbia NLP faculty member or PhD student and wish to be subscribed to the latter list, please have them email Amith Ananthram and he can add you :)
