## Hey!

![A scribbled likeness of myself.](/assets/img/profile.png){:height="256px" width="256px"}

I'm [Fei-Tzin](about.html), a final-year PhD candidate in [NLP at Columbia University](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi). I am advised by [Kathy McKeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/). I am currently at an internship with the AWS Comprehend team in NYC.

My thesis work explores applications of structured semantic representations of text. My [candidacy exam](candidacy.html) was on word embeddings.

I previously co-organized the [NLP seminar at Columbia](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/nlp_seminar.html) along with the current organizer, [Emily Allaway](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~eallaway/). I am the current administrator of the public [Columbia NLP mailing list](https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/nlp-announce) as well as the internal Columbia NLP group mailing list. If you are currently doing research with a Columbia NLP faculty member or PhD student and wish to be subscribed to the latter list, please have them email me and I will add you.
