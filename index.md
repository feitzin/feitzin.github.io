## Hey!

![A scribbled likeness of myself.](/assets/img/profile.png){:height="256px" width="256px"}

I'm [Fei-Tzin](about.html), a fifth-year PhD candidate in [NLP at Columbia University](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/index.cgi). I work with [Kathy McKeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/) and [Nakul Verma](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~verma/).

I am broadly interested in how we can represent semantics in language, and in the properties of such representations. My [candidacy exam](candidacy.html) was on word embeddings.

I co-organize the [NLP seminar at Columbia](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~eallaway/nlp_seminar.html) along with [Emily Allaway](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~eallaway/). I am also the current administrator of the [Columbia NLP mailing list](https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/nlp-announce).
