You stand in the doorway to our office. In the corner to your left, a large poster on style transfer featuring an enormous hand-painted watercolor raven languishes behind our minifridge. My desk sits against the left wall, overflowing with papers. Next to it is Chris' desk, which extends into the far left corner. Elsbeth's desk is across from Chris' against the right wall.

Around the corner, past the elevators, is [7LW1](/secrets/7LW1.html).
