title: A dusty arch
---

You stand beneath an archway of cracked, weathered stone. The rain-tempered daylight filters past you from behind, weakly illuminating the first few paces into the cavernous expanse that lies ahead. The walls rise up like towering giants to meet a vaulted ceiling high above, invisible in the darkness but for the pinpricks of light that glitter like stars in its surface.

You are at the entrance to the storied Library of Secrets, in which legendary knowledge is fabled to slumber.

Before you, just past daylight's reach, is a [small stone plinth](/secrets/tablet.html).
