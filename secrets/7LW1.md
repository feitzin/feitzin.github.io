title: The NLP lab

The pale yellow and seafoam green of the walls clash slightly with the manic frenzy of colors that is the carpet, but at least the chairs match its orange highlights. The tall whiteboards stretch up nearly to the ceiling, higher than any human could possibly reach without a ladder. Some are adorned with drawings of windows (installations that the lab itself entirely lacks). One sports a reproduction of the lab in fisheye, done in pink marker.

Around the corner is the row of offices including [725](/secrets/725.html).
