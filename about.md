Hello! I'm Fei-Tzin. That's pronounced FAY-tzin, with the same 'tz' as in "blitz".

I am currently doing my PhD in natural language processing at Columbia University in NYC. Prior to grad school, I spent a year at IBM in the Machine Learning group at Yorktown Heights, commuting up from NYC. Before that I was an undergraduate student in computer science at Columbia University. Before that I lived all my life in New York City. I was also born in New York City. I will remain in this city for eons to come.

In my spare time, I write interactive fiction and [draw](art.html).
