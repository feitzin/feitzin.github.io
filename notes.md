Information on my candidacy exam can be found [here](candidacy.html).

The notes below are intended to serve as a reference for useful things whose details I may later forget. They should be easier to access here than in the unknown depths of my bookshelf towards which all my physical papers tend to float after a while. These notes are not guaranteed to be complete or mistake-free. Read at your own peril.
