Information on my candidacy exam can be found [here](candidacy.html).

I gave a guest lecture on word embeddings for [Kathy McKeown's section of NLP](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/NLP/2019/) in the Fall 2019 semester. Slides can be found [here](files/embeddings-101.pdf).

My thesis defense slides can be found [here](files/defense.pdf).

<!--Some notes on miscellaneous topics can be found below. They are less a complete reference and more a summary of what I find interesting about the topic. The aim is to be clear enough that my non-NLP friends can understand most of what's going on, but thorough enough to later remind myself of the useful details I'm sure I will forget.

Disclaimer: I make plenty of mistakes in daily life and I am sure that extends to these notes as well. Read at your own peril.
