Information on my candidacy exam can be found [here](candidacy.html).

I gave a guest lecture on word embeddings for [Kathy McKeown's section of NLP](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/NLP/2019/) in the Fall 2019 semester. Slides can be found [here](files/embeddings-101.pdf).

<!--The notes below are intended to serve as a reference for useful things whose details I may later forget. They should be easier to access here than in the unknown depths of my bookshelf towards which all my physical papers tend to float after a while.

These notes are not guaranteed to be complete or mistake-free. Read at your own peril.
