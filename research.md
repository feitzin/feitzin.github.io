### What do I do?

I am generally interested in semantic representations. My thesis work explores how we can use explicit semantic representations at intermediate stages of a neural pipeline. In the past, I have worked on the [Columbia SAFE Lab](https://safelab.socialwork.columbia.edu)'s [gang violence prevention project](https://safelab.socialwork.columbia.edu/research-projects/natural-language-processing-tools-gang-violence-prevention) as well as on analyzing therapeutic conversation.
