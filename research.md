### What do I do?

My current interests are focused around analyzing and understanding continuous representations of semantics in text (specifically, word embeddings). In the past, I have worked on the [Columbia SAFE Lab](https://safelab.socialwork.columbia.edu)'s [gang violence prevention project](https://safelab.socialwork.columbia.edu/research-projects/natural-language-processing-tools-gang-violence-prevention), as well as on analyzing therapeutic conversation.
